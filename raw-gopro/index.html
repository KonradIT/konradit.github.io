<h1>Raw pictures with a GoPro Camera</h1>
There is a hack to shoot pictures in <b>.raw</b> encoding using GoPro HERO3 Black camera.
<br>In order the hack to work, the camera will take a picture 5 seconds after the boot and it will render a .raw that will take the camera around 40 seconds, it will stop rendering the .raw picture when it takes another photo. Then it turns off.
<br>So the camera acts as in One button mode.
The GoPro will generate three files:
<ul>
<li>A .JPG image</li>
<li>A .RAW image (the file is large, ~20MBs)</li>
<li>A .txt text with information about the raw image such as tone curve, gray something, blah blah blah</li>
<li>And... It also generates lots of .bin useless files</li>
