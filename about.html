	<h2>About</h2>
	Hi, I am Konrad Iturbe.
	<br>
I am a developer, I program apps in my free time or when I am not busy with a pile of homework, I've had various devices on my hands through the years and that shaped my programming skills. I started writing bash scripts in 2012 which optimized my computer use and then went onto writing scripts for GoPro action cameras and other Ambarella powered cameras, then got a decent android phone, learned Java and published numerous apps in the Google Play Store, then in 2014 I was introduced to the world of wearable devices and Internet of Things with an android wear smartwatch, naturally my curious instinct kicked in and I maximized the utlitity, use and flexibility of such android wearable, I made a GoPro Remote for Android Wear (I am also a huge GoPro addict if you haven't noticed), an app to dim the watch on command and several others, at this point you might have realized that I am hooked to action cameras, Android/Linux in general, good, keep reading.

<br>In the future I plan to do something related to network security or IoT.

<br>My full time desktop OS is Arch and my phone OS is Android, I program in Java, JavaScript, C and I know how to compile an Android image.
